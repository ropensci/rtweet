```

This vignette provides a quick tour of the R package.

```{r}
library("rtweet")
```

## Authenticate

First you should set up your own credentials, this should be done just once ever:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
auth_setup_default()
```

Which will look up your account on your browser and create a token and save it as default.
From now on, on this R session on others we can use this authentication with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
auth_as("default")
```

Automatically rtweet will use that token in all the API queries it will do in the session.

If you want to set up a bot or collect a lot of information, please read the `vignette("auth", "rtweet")`.

```{r include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")
library("rtweet")
auth_as(rtweet:::rtweet_test())
```

## Search tweets

You can search tweets:

```{r search_tweets0}
## search for 18000 tweets using the rstats hashtag
rstats <- search_tweets("#rstats", n = 100, include_rts = FALSE)
colnames(rstats)
rstats[1:5, c("created_at", "text", "id_str")]
```

The `include_rts = FALSE` excludes retweets from the search.

Twitter rate limits the number of calls to the endpoints you can do.
See `rate_limit()` and the [rate limit section](#Rate-limit) below.
If your query requires more calls like the example below, simply set `retryonratelimit = TRUE` and rtweet will wait for rate limit resets for you.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## search for 250,000 tweets containing the word data
tweets_peace <- search_tweets("peace", n = 250000, retryonratelimit = TRUE)
```

Search by geo-location, for example tweets in the English language sent from the United States.

```{r search_tweets}
# search for tweets sent from the US
# lookup_coords requires Google maps API key for maps outside usa, canada and world
geo_tweets <- search_tweets("lang:en", geocode = lookup_coords("usa"), n = 100)
geo_tweets[1:5, c("created_at", "text", "id_str", "lang", "place")]
```

You can check the location of these tweets with `lat_lng()`.
Or quickly visualize frequency of tweets over time using `ts_plot()` (if `ggplot2` is installed).

```{r plot1}
## plot time series of tweets
ts_plot(rstats) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = "Frequency of #rstats Twitter statuses from past 9 days",
    subtitle = "Twitter status (tweet) counts aggregated using three-hour intervals",
    caption = "Source: Data collected from Twitter's REST API via rtweet"
  )
```

## Posting statuses

You can post tweets with:

```{r post_tweet}
post_tweet(paste0("My first tweet with #rtweet #rstats at ", Sys.time()))
```

It can include media and alt text:

```{r baseplot}
path_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
png(filename = path_file)
plot(mpg ~ cyl, mtcars, col = gear, pch = gear)
dev.off()
post_tweet("my first tweet with #rtweet with media #rstats", media = path_file, media_alt_text = "Plot of mtcars dataset, showing cyl vs mpg colored by gear. The lower cyl the higher the mpg is.")
```

You can also reply to a previous tweet, retweet and provide additional information.

## Get friends

Retrieve a list of all the accounts a **user follows**.
```{r get_friends}
## get user IDs of accounts followed by R Foundation
R_foundation_fds <- get_friends("_R_Foundation")
R_foundation_fds
```

Using `get_friends()` we can retrieve which users are being followed by the R Foundation.

## Get followers

If you really want all the users that follow the account we can use `get_followers()`:
```{r get_followers}
R_foundation_flw <- get_followers("_R_Foundation", n = 30000,
                                  retryonratelimit = TRUE)
```

Note that the `retryonratelimit` option is intended for when you need more queries than provided by Twitter on a given period.
You might want to check with `rate_limit()` how many does it provide for the endpoints you are using.
If exceeded `retryonratelimit` waits till the there are more calls available and then resumes the query.

## Lookup users

As seen above we can use `lookup_users()` to check their

```{r lookup_users}
# Look who is following R Foundation
R_foundation_fds_data <- lookup_users(R_foundation_fds$to_id, verbose = FALSE)
R_foundation_fds_data[, c("name", "screen_name", "created_at")]

# Look 100 R Foundation followers
R_foundation_flw_data <- lookup_users(head(R_foundation_flw$from_id, 100), verbose = FALSE)
R_foundation_flw_data[1:5, c("name", "screen_name", "created_at")]
```

We have now the information from those followed by the R Foundation and its followers.
We can retrieve their latest tweets from these users:

```{r tweets_data}
tweets_data(R_foundation_fds_data)[, c("created_at", "text")]
```

## Search users

Search for 1,000 users with the rstats hashtag in their profile bios.
```{r search_users}
## search for users with #rstats in their profiles
useRs <- search_users("#rstats", n = 100, verbose = FALSE)
useRs[, c("name", "screen_name", "created_at")]
```

If we want to know what have they tweeted about we can use `tweets_data()`:
```{r tweets_data2}
useRs_twt <- tweets_data(useRs)
useRs_twt[1:5, c("id_str", "created_at", "text")]
```

## Get timelines

Get the most recent tweets from R Foundation.
```{r plot2}
## get user IDs of accounts followed by R Foundation
R_foundation_tline <- get_timeline("_R_Foundation")

## plot the frequency of tweets for each user over time
plot <- R_foundation_tline |>
  filter(created_at > "2017-10-29") |>
  ts_plot(by = "month", trim = 1L) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = "Frequency of Twitter statuses posted by the R Foundation",
    subtitle = "Twitter status (tweet) counts aggregated by month from October/November 2017",
    caption = "Source: Data collected from Twitter's REST API via rtweet"
  )
```

## Get favorites

Get the 10 recently favorited statuses by R Foundation.

```{r get_favorites}
R_foundation_favs <- get_favorites("_R_Foundation", n = 10)
R_foundation_favs[, c("text", "created_at", "id_str")]
```


## Get trends

Discover what's currently trending in San Francisco.
```{r get_trends}
world <- get_trends("world")
world
```

## Following users

You can follow users and unfollow them:

```{r}
post_follow("_R_Foundation")
post_unfollow_user("rtweet_test")
```

## Managing data

There are some functions to help analyze the data extracted from the API.

With `clean_tweets()` you can remove users mentions, hashtags, urls and media to keep only the text if you want to do sentiment analysis (you might want to remove emojis too).

```{r clean_tweets}
clean_tweets(head(R_foundation_favs), clean = c("users", "hashtags", "urls", "media"))
```

With `entity()` you can access any entity of the tweets.
It returns the id of the tweet and the corresponding data field in the selected entity.

```{r helpers}
head(entity(R_foundation_favs, "urls"))
head(entity(R_foundation_favs, "hashtags"))
head(entity(R_foundation_favs, "symbols"))
head(entity(R_foundation_favs, "user_mentions"))
head(entity(R_foundation_favs, "media"))
```

To avoid having two columns with the same name, `user_mentions()` renames to  the ids  from "id" and "id_str" to "user_id" and "user_id_str".

[1]: Also applies to users ids

## Muting users

You can mute and unmute users:

```{r post_follow, eval=FALSE}
post_follow("rtweet_test", mute = TRUE)
post_follow("rtweet_test", mute = FALSE)
```


## Blocking users

You can block users and unblock them:

```{r user_block}
user_block("RTweetTest1")
user_unblock("RTweetTest1")
```



## Rate limits

Twitter sets a limited number of calls to their endpoints for different authentications (check `vignette("auth", "rtweet")` to find which one is better for your use case).
To consult those limits you can use `rate_limt()`

```{r rate_limit}
rate_limit()
# Search only those related to followers
rate_limit("followers")
```

The remaining column shows the number of times that you can call and endpoint (not the numbers of followers you can search).
After a query the number should decrease until it is reset again.

If your queries return an error, check if you already exhausted your quota and try after the time on "reset_at".

## Stream tweets

Please, see the vignette on `vignette("stream", "rtweet")` for more information.

## SessionInfo

To provide real examples the vignette is precomputed before submission.
Also note that results returned by the API will change.

```{r session, class.source = "fold-hide"}
sessionInfo()
```
